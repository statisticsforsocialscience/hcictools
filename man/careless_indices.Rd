\usage{
careless_indices(
  dat,
  speeder_analysis = "median/2",
  likert_vector = NULL,
  duration_column = "Duration (in seconds)",
  id_column = "ResponseId"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{A data.frame that contains the survey data.}

\item{speeder_analysis}{A criterion to test against speeders. The
speeder_analysis parameter can be one of the following: median,
median/2 (default), median/3, or a numeric value that is directly used
as a threshold. Using FALSE will ignore speeder analysis.}

\item{likert_vector}{A vector of indices that should be analyzed.}

\item{duration_column}{A string that contains the name of the column that
has the duration of survey responses. As a default we use
Duration (in seconds), which is used by Qualtrix.}

\item{id_column}{A string that contains the name of a id column. As a default
we use "ResponseId", which is used by Qualtrix.}
}
\value{
Returns an updated dataframe containing indices
}
\description{
A function to detect careless survey responses using the careless package.
The function has the improvement to first remove speeders, because they
negatively affect the metrics used in the careless package.
