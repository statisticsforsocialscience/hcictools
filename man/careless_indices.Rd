\arguments{
\item{dat}{A data.frame that contains the survey data.}

\item{likert_vector}{A vector containing the numeric addresses of the numeric likert items in dat.
Leaving this parameter NULL (default) still allows for speeder analysis.
#' @param id_column A string that contains the name of the id column. As a default
we use "ResponseId", which is used by Qualtrics.
#' @param duration_column A string that contains the name of the column that
has the duration of survey responses. As a default we use
Duration (in seconds), which is used by Qualtrics.}

\item{speeder_analysis}{A criterion to test against speeders. The
speeder_analysis parameter can be one of the following: median,
median/2 (default), median/3, or a numeric value that is directly used
as a threshold. Using FALSE will ignore speeder analysis.}

\item{critval_longstring}{A numeric as a threshold for longstring analysis. Longstrings will be flagged and not considered in further analysis.}

\item{critval_avgstring}{A numeric as a threshold for average longstring analysis. Average longstrings will be flagged and not considered in further analysis.}

\item{critval_irv_low}{A numeric as a lower threshold for inter response variance analysis. IRV will be flagged and not considered in further analysis.}

\item{critval_irv_high}{A numeric as an upper threshold for inter response variance analysis. IRV will be flagged and not considered in further analysis.}

\item{antonyms}{Should psychometric antonyms be calculated?}

\item{critval_ant}{Threshold for antonym analysis (Default: -0.6)}

\item{synonyms}{Should psychometric synonyms be calculated?}

\item{critval_syn}{Threshold for antonym analysis (Default: 0.6)}

\item{mahaD}{Whether or not to test for mahalanobis distance with confidence of 0.99. (Default: TRUE)}
}

\description{
A function to detect careless survey responses using the careless package.
The big improvement is that subject with out of bounds individual criterions (speeders, longstring, average longstring and inter response variance)
are automatically excluded from the calculation of inter-individual criterions (psychometric synonyms, psychometric antonyms and Mahananobis Distance).
